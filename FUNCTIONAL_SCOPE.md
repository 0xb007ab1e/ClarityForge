# ClarityForge - Functional Scope and API Contract

## Overview

ClarityForge is an AI-powered project bootstrapping platform that helps developers and teams quickly set up new software projects with proper structure, alignment to project vision, and automated configuration. The platform consists of multiple micro-services that work together to provide a comprehensive project setup experience.

## Stakeholder Requirements Analysis

Based on the existing codebase, tests, and project structure, the following stakeholder requirements have been identified:

### Primary Stakeholders

- **DevOps Engineers**: Need consistent CI/CD and infrastructure setup
- **System Administrators**: Need health monitoring and security controls

### Secondary Stakeholders
- **Technical Architects**: Need template management and customization
- **Security Teams**: Need secure sandbox execution and encryption
- **Quality Assurance**: Need automated testing setup and validation

## Core Functional Requirements

- `getVisionStatement`: Retrieve current project vision statement
- `updateVisionStatement`: Update or set new project vision statement

**Business Rules**:
- Similarity threshold of 0.85 (configurable)
- Content flagged below threshold requires review
- Support for multiple content types (code, docs, requirements, features)
- Version tracking for vision statements

### 2. Project Scaffolding Service (`/v1/scaffolding/*`)

**Purpose**: Generate and execute comprehensive project setup plans based on requirements and preferences.

**Key Behaviors**:
- `generateScaffoldingPlan`: Create detailed project setup plan from requirements
- `executeScaffoldingPlan`: Execute plan to create project structure and files
- `getProjectTemplates`: Retrieve available project templates

**Business Rules**:
- Support multiple project types (web, API, mobile, desktop, data science, ML)
- Configurable technology stacks
- Team size and timeline considerations
- Effort estimation and complexity analysis
- Template categorization and filtering

### 3. AI Conversation Management (`/v1/conversation/*`)

**Purpose**: Facilitate AI-powered requirement gathering and project planning conversations.

**Key Behaviors**:
- `startConversation`: Initiate AI-assisted requirement gathering session
- `sendMessage`: Exchange messages with AI assistant
- `getConversation`: Retrieve conversation history and extracted requirements
- `endConversation`: Terminate conversation and extract final requirements

**Business Rules**:
- Session-based conversation management
- Requirement extraction from natural language
- Follow-up question generation
- Context preservation across messages
- Support for both user input and system commands

### 4. Data Storage Service (`/v1/datastore/*`)

**Purpose**: Persistent storage for project data, conversations, and generated plans.

**Key Behaviors**:
- `storeProject`: Save project information and metadata
- `listProjects`: Retrieve paginated list of stored projects
- `getProject`: Fetch specific project by ID

**Business Rules**:
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- Configurable data retention policies
- Support for metadata and custom fields
- Pagination for large datasets
- Unique project identification (UUID)

### 5. AI Engine Service (`/v1/ai-engine/*`)

**Purpose**: Provide AI-powered analysis and processing capabilities.

**Key Behaviors**:
- `analyzeContent`: Perform AI analysis (code review, requirements extraction, tech recommendations)
- `getAvailableModels`: List available AI models and their capabilities

**Business Rules**:
- Multiple analysis types supported
- Configurable AI models (GPT-4, etc.)
- Confidence scoring for AI results
- Processing time tracking
- Model capability matching

### 6. Health Monitoring (`/v1/health/*`)

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive health checking for all micro-services.

**Key Behaviors**:
- `getPlatformHealth`: Overall platform health status
- `getVisionAlignmentHealth`: Vision alignment service health
- `getScaffoldingHealth`: Scaffolding service health

**Business Rules**:
- Real-time health status reporting
- Service-level health details
- Degraded vs unhealthy status differentiation
- Timestamp tracking for health checks

## Security and Safety Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization
- API Key authentication (`X-API-Key` header)
- Bearer token authentication (JWT)
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for stored project data
- Configurable encryption key management
- Secure handling of vision statements and requirements

### Sandbox Security
- Restricted command execution in agent sandbox
- File system access limitations
- Network access controls
- Command validation and filtering

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements
- Health check responses < 100ms
- Vision alignment checks < 5 seconds
- Plan generation < 30 seconds
- Plan execution < 5 minutes (depending on complexity)

### Scalability Requirements
- Support for concurrent conversations
- Horizontal scaling of micro-services
- Database connection pooling
- Caching for frequently accessed data

### Reliability Requirements
- 99.9% uptime for health endpoints
- Graceful degradation when AI services unavailable
- Data backup and recovery procedures
- Error handling and logging

## API Versioning Strategy

### URL Versioning
- Base URL pattern: `{server}/v1/*`
- Version in URL path for clear API evolution
- Backward compatibility for at least 2 major versions

### Version Evolution Rules
- Breaking changes require new major version
- Additive changes can be made within existing version
- Deprecation notices for removed features
- Migration guides for version upgrades

## Request/Response Schemas

All request and response schemas are defined using JSON Schema in the OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`). Key schema patterns include:

### Standard Response Format
```json
{
  "data": { /* actual response data */ },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "error": "ERROR_CODE",
  "message": "Human readable error message",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "details": { /* additional error context */ }
}
```

### Validation Error Format
```json
{
  "error": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Request validation failed",
  "validation_errors": [
    {
      "field": "field_name",
      "error": "Field-specific error message"
    }
  ]
}
```
