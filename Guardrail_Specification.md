## Guardrail Details

### G001: Consistent Project Naming
*   **Protocol Step:** Project Identity Configuration
*   **Risk Level:** Medium
*   **Rationale:** Inconsistent project naming can lead to confusion and errors when referencing the project in different contexts, such as in the file system, version control, and documentation.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   The project name is identical across all configuration files, documentation, and external systems.
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   Verify that the `{ProjectName}` variable is used consistently in all subsequent steps of the bootstrap protocol.

### G002: Secure VCS Configuration
*   **Protocol Step:** Environment Configuration
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Rationale:** Improperly configured version control can expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to the codebase.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   The remote repository is created with the correct visibility settings (e.g., `Public`).
    *   The local project is successfully linked to the remote repository.
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   Attempt to access the remote repository without proper authentication.
    *   Verify that the initial commit is successfully pushed to the remote repository.

### G003: Ruleset Modification Approval
*   **Protocol Step:** Agent Ruleset Configuration
*   **Risk Level:** High
*   **Rationale:** Unauthorized or undocumented changes to the agent's ruleset can have unintended and potentially harmful consequences.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   All modifications to the `Agent Ruleset` are documented in the designated issue tracker.
    *   Issues related to ruleset modifications are correctly labeled.
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   Modify the `Agent Ruleset` and verify that a new issue is created in the issue tracker.
    *   Verify that the issue contains the required information (change, rationale, user story).

### G004: Standardized Issue Labels
*   **Protocol Step:** Project Management Configuration
*   **Risk Level:** Low
*   **Rationale:** A lack of standardized issue labels can make it difficult to search, filter, and report on project tasks.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   The defined set of issue labels is created in the designated issue tracker.
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   Verify that all the specified issue labels exist in the issue tracker.

### G005: Retrospective Issue Creation
*   **Protocol Step:** Backlog Seeding (Retrospective)
*   **Risk Level:** Low
*   **Rationale:** Failing to document the project's bootstrap process can make it difficult for new team members to understand the project's history and rationale.
*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   All retrospective issues are created in the issue tracker.
*   **Test Cases:**
    *   Verify that the three retrospective issues (Project Naming, Technical Setup, and Process Definition) are created in the issue tracker with the correct titles, bodies, and labels.
