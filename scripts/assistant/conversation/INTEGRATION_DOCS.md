# AIEngine Integration with ConversationManager

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the AIEngine with the ConversationManager, which enables enhanced analysis capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Summarization
- The `summarize_idea()` method now uses `ai_engine.analyze_and_summarize()` for improved results
- Fallback to original summarization method if enhanced analysis fails
- Provides confidence scores and detailed analysis results

### 2. User-Requested Analysis
- Automatic detection of analysis requests in user input
- Support for multiple analysis types:
  - `requirement_extraction`: Extract key requirements from conversations
  - `tech_recommendation`: Suggest appropriate technologies and tools
  - `risk_assessment`: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
  - `code_review`: Review code quality and suggest improvements
  - `summarization`: Generate concise summaries (default)

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality remains unchanged
- New `generate_response()` method added to AIEngine for compatibility
- Graceful fallback when enhanced features are unavailable

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation Flow
```python
from scripts.assistant.ai_engine import AIEngine
from scripts.assistant.conversation.manager import ConversationManager
from scripts.assistant.datastore import Datastore

# Initialize components
ai_engine = AIEngine()
datastore = Datastore()
manager = ConversationManager(ai_engine, datastore)

# Start conversation (enhanced summarization will be used automatically)
manager.start_conversation()
```

### Manual Analysis
```python
# Set up conversation history
manager.conversation_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I want to build a secure e-commerce platform"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "What features are most important?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Payment processing, user accounts, and inventory management"}
]

# Perform different types of analysis
requirements = manager.analyze_conversation("requirement_extraction")
tech_recommendations = manager.analyze_conversation("tech_recommendation")
risk_assessment = manager.analyze_conversation("risk_assessment")
```

### Analysis Request Detection
During conversation, users can trigger analysis by using keywords such as:
- "Can you analyze our discussion?"
- "Please extract the requirements"
- "What technology would you recommend?"
- "Are there any risks we should consider?"

## Architecture

### ConversationManager Updates
1. **Enhanced `summarize_idea()` method**: Uses `ai_engine.analyze_and_summarize()` with fallback
2. **New `analyze_conversation()` method**: Provides direct access to analysis capabilities
3. **Analysis request detection**: `_is_analysis_request()` and `_determine_analysis_type()` methods
4. **Interactive analysis display**: `_display_analysis_results()` for formatted output

### AIEngine Updates
1. **Backward compatibility**: Added `generate_response()` method
2. **Enhanced analysis**: `analyze_and_summarize()` method integrates with `analyze_content`
3. **Graceful fallback**: Uses mock implementation when API is unavailable

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN`: Required for real AI model access (optional, falls back to mock)

### Supported Models
- `gpt2`: General-purpose text generation (default)
- `facebook/bart-large-mnli`: Classification and inference

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **API Unavailability**: Falls back to mock implementation
2. **Model Failures**: Returns error details with 0.0 confidence
3. **Invalid Input**: Provides helpful error messages
4. **Network Issues**: Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Testing

Run the integration tests to verify functionality:

```bash
cd /home/b007ab1e/src/ClarityForge
python scripts/assistant/conversation/test_integration.py
```

The test suite covers:
- Basic integration between components
- Different analysis types
- Analysis request detection
- Error handling and fallbacks

## Migration Guide

### Existing Code
No changes required for existing code using ConversationManager. All existing functionality continues to work as before.

### New Features
To use enhanced analysis features:

1. **Enhanced Summarization**: Automatically enabled, no code changes needed
2. **Manual Analysis**: Use `manager.analyze_conversation(analysis_type)`
3. **Interactive Analysis**: Users can request analysis during conversation

### Performance Considerations
- Analysis requests may take longer than simple responses
- Mock implementation is used when API is unavailable for consistent performance
- Caching is implemented for model metadata

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
1. Additional analysis types (sentiment analysis, language detection)
2. Streaming responses for real-time analysis
3. Custom model fine-tuning for domain-specific analysis
4. Integration with other AI service providers
5. Conversation memory and context persistence

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN not set"**: Set the environment variable or rely on mock implementation
2. **"404 Model Not Found"**: Update model configuration in `supported_models`
3. **Analysis timeouts**: Check network connectivity and API service status

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

This will provide detailed information about analysis requests, processing times, and confidence scores.
