# [Project Manager] Intelligent Requirement Extraction from Project Documents

## User Story
As a **Project Manager** overseeing software development projects in ClarityForge, I want to use the AI Engine Service to automatically extract and categorize functional and non-functional requirements from project documents, specifications, and stakeholder communications, so that I can ensure comprehensive requirement coverage, reduce manual analysis time, and maintain accurate project documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] The AI Engine Service `/ai-engine/analyze` endpoint processes requirement extraction requests with `analysis_type: "requirement_extraction"`
- [ ] The system extracts requirements from multiple document formats (PDF, Word, Markdown, plain text, emails)
- [ ] Requirements are automatically categorized as Functional, Non-functional, Business, Technical, or Constraint requirements
- [ ] Each extracted requirement includes priority classification (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have - MoSCoW)
- [ ] The system identifies requirement dependencies and relationships between requirements
- [ ] Results include source document references with page/section numbers for traceability
- [ ] Requirements are validated for completeness, clarity, and testability with quality scores

### Should Have
- [ ] Integration with project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello) for automatic ticket creation
- [ ] Duplicate requirement detection across multiple documents
- [ ] Requirement change tracking and version history
- [ ] Stakeholder mapping for each requirement (who requested, who approved)
- [ ] Export functionality to standard formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)

### Could Have
- [ ] Natural language requirement refinement suggestions
- [ ] Risk assessment for each requirement (complexity, feasibility)
- [ ] Automatic test case generation from functional requirements
- [ ] Integration with contract and legal document analysis

## Technical Plan

### Phase 1: Document Processing Foundation (Sprint 1-2)
1. **Document Ingestion Pipeline**
   - Implement multi-format document parser (PDF using PyPDF2, DOCX using python-docx)
   - Create text extraction and preprocessing pipeline
   - Develop document structure analysis (headers, sections, lists)

2. **Requirement Extraction Engine**
   - Enhance existing FLAN-T5 model prompts for requirement identification
   - Implement `RequirementExtractor` class in `scripts/ai_engine/`
   - Create regex patterns and NLP rules for requirement sentence detection
   - Develop requirement classification algorithms using BART model

3. **API Integration**
   - Extend `/ai-engine/analyze` endpoint for document upload
   - Implement file validation and size limits (max 50MB)
   - Add structured response schema for requirement extraction results

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (Sprint 3-4)
1. **Requirement Quality Assessment**
   - Implement SMART criteria validation (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Create ambiguity detection algorithms
   - Develop testability scoring system

2. **Relationship Mapping**
   - Build dependency detection using semantic similarity
   - Implement conflict identification between requirements
   - Create requirement traceability matrix generation

3. **Integration and Export**
   - Develop Jira API integration for ticket creation
   - Implement export functionality to multiple formats
   - Create requirement template generation

### Technical Dependencies
- **New Dependencies**: `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`, `pandas` for export, `requests` for integrations
- **Model Enhancements**: Fine-tune BART model for requirement classification
- **Storage**: File storage system for uploaded documents (AWS S3 or local filesystem)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Document parsing accuracy for each supported format
- [ ] Requirement extraction precision and recall testing
- [ ] Classification accuracy for different requirement types
- [ ] Quality scoring algorithm validation
- [ ] API endpoint functionality with various document types

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end document upload and processing workflow
- [ ] External tool integration testing (Jira, Azure DevOps)
- [ ] Large document processing (>100 pages) performance testing
- [ ] Concurrent document processing load testing
- [ ] Export functionality testing across all supported formats

### User Acceptance Tests
- [ ] Project manager workflow testing with real project documents
- [ ] Requirement extraction accuracy validation by domain experts
- [ ] Usability testing for requirement review and editing interface
- [ ] Integration workflow testing with existing PM tools
- [ ] Performance testing with typical project document sizes

### Test Data
- Collect diverse project documents (RFPs, PRDs, technical specifications)
- Create ground truth dataset with manually identified requirements
- Prepare test documents with intentional ambiguities and conflicts
- Gather real-world project documents from various domains

## Definition of Done

### Technical DoD
- [ ] Requirement extraction feature implemented and deployed to staging
- [ ] Document processing supports PDF, DOCX, MD, and TXT formats
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >85% code coverage
- [ ] Performance meets criteria: <2 minutes for 50-page documents
- [ ] API documentation includes requirement extraction examples and schemas
- [ ] Security review completed for document upload and processing

### Product DoD
- [ ] Feature extracts requirements with >80% precision and >75% recall
- [ ] Successfully categorizes requirements into 5+ categories with >85% accuracy
- [ ] Quality scoring correlates with manual expert assessment (>0.7 correlation)
- [ ] Project manager user testing shows >4/5 satisfaction rating
- [ ] Integration with at least 2 major project management tools working
- [ ] Production deployment with monitoring and alerting configured

### Quality DoD
- [ ] Follows ClarityForge security standards for document handling
- [ ] Implements proper error handling for corrupted or unsupported documents
- [ ] Data privacy compliance for sensitive project documents
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for document processing activities
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures for uploaded documents
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management for document processing

## Notes
- Consider GDPR and data privacy implications for document processing
- Implement document retention policies and automatic cleanup
- Monitor Hugging Face API usage costs for large document processing
- Plan for offline capability for sensitive documents that cannot leave premises
- Consider integration with version control systems for requirement change tracking
