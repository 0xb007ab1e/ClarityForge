# [Team Lead] AI-Powered Technology Stack Recommendations

## User Story
As a **Team Lead** responsible for technical decision-making in software projects, I want to use the AI Engine Service to receive intelligent technology stack recommendations based on project requirements, team expertise, and constraints, so that I can make informed architectural decisions that optimize for performance, maintainability, cost-effectiveness, and team productivity while minimizing technical risks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] The AI Engine Service `/ai-engine/analyze` endpoint processes technology recommendation requests with `analysis_type: "tech_recommendation"`
- [ ] The system analyzes project requirements and suggests appropriate technology stacks (frontend, backend, database, infrastructure)
- [ ] Recommendations include detailed rationale explaining why each technology is suggested
- [ ] Each recommendation includes pros/cons analysis with relevance to the specific project context
- [ ] The system considers team skill levels and learning curve requirements for each technology
- [ ] Recommendations are categorized by component type (Web Framework, Database, Cloud Platform, etc.)
- [ ] Results include implementation complexity estimates and timeline impact assessments

### Should Have
- [ ] Integration with technology trend analysis and community adoption metrics
- [ ] Cost estimation for different technology choices (licensing, hosting, maintenance)
- [ ] Security assessment for recommended technologies including vulnerability history
- [ ] Performance benchmarking data for recommended technology combinations
- [ ] Alternative technology suggestions with trade-off analysis
- [ ] Migration path recommendations for legacy system modernization

### Could Have
- [ ] Integration with team skill assessment tools and training recommendations
- [ ] Vendor comparison and evaluation matrices
- [ ] Compliance and regulatory requirement mapping for specific industries
- [ ] Technology stack validation against company standards and policies

## Technical Plan

### Phase 1: Core Recommendation Engine (Sprint 1-2)
1. **Technology Knowledge Base**
   - Create comprehensive technology database with categories, features, and attributes
   - Implement technology compatibility matrix and dependency mapping
   - Build cost and licensing information repository
   - Develop technology trend and adoption metrics collection

2. **Recommendation Algorithm**
   - Implement `TechRecommendationEngine` class in `scripts/ai_engine/`
   - Create requirement-to-technology mapping algorithms
   - Develop scoring system based on multiple criteria (performance, cost, complexity, team fit)
   - Build decision tree models for technology selection logic

3. **API Enhancement**
   - Extend `/ai-engine/analyze` endpoint with tech recommendation schema
   - Implement structured input for project requirements and constraints
   - Create detailed response format with rationale and alternatives

### Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (Sprint 3-4)
1. **Market Intelligence Integration**
   - Integrate with technology trend APIs (GitHub trending, Stack Overflow surveys)
   - Implement vulnerability database integration (CVE, security advisories)
   - Create performance benchmarking data collection and analysis

2. **Team and Context Analysis**
   - Develop team skill assessment integration
   - Implement project constraint analysis (budget, timeline, compliance)
   - Create learning curve and onboarding time estimation

3. **Recommendation Optimization**
   - Build A/B testing framework for recommendation quality
   - Implement feedback loop for recommendation accuracy improvement
   - Create technology stack validation and compatibility checking

### Technical Dependencies
- **New Dependencies**: `requests` for API integrations, `numpy` for scoring algorithms, `sqlite3` for tech database
- **External APIs**: GitHub API, Stack Overflow API, CVE database APIs
- **Data Sources**: Technology vendor APIs, performance benchmarking databases
