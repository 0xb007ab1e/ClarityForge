# [SysAdmin] AI Model Availability and Performance Monitoring System

## User Story
As a **System Administrator** responsible for maintaining the ClarityForge AI Engine Service infrastructure, I want to implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for AI model availability, performance metrics, and service health, so that I can ensure high system reliability, proactively address issues before they impact users, and maintain optimal performance of all AI-powered features across the platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
- [ ] Real-time monitoring of all Hugging Face API model endpoints (FLAN-T5, BART, and any additional models)
- [ ] Service health dashboard showing model response times, error rates, and availability percentages
- [ ] Automated alerting system for model failures, high latency (>30s), and API rate limit warnings
- [ ] Performance metrics collection including request/response times, throughput, and success rates
- [ ] Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana, or equivalent)
- [ ] Health check endpoints for each analysis type (code_review, requirement_extraction, tech_recommendation)
- [ ] Automated failover mechanism to backup models when primary models are unavailable

### Should Have
- [ ] Historical performance analytics with trend analysis and capacity planning insights
- [ ] Cost monitoring and budget alerts for AI model API usage
- [ ] Model performance regression detection with automatic rollback capabilities
- [ ] Integration with incident management systems (PagerDuty, Slack, email notifications)
- [ ] Service dependency mapping and cascade failure detection
- [ ] Automated model warmup and cache preloading during high-traffic periods

### Could Have
- [ ] Predictive maintenance alerts based on performance degradation patterns
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipeline for model deployment validation
- [ ] Multi-region failover support for geographic redundancy
- [ ] Custom SLA monitoring and reporting for different user tiers

## Technical Plan

### Phase 1: Core Monitoring Infrastructure (Sprint 1-2)
1. **Health Check System**
   - Implement comprehensive health check endpoints in the AI Engine Service
   - Create `/health/models` endpoint to test each AI model individually
   - Develop `/health/dependencies` endpoint for external service monitoring
   - Build synthetic transaction monitoring for end-to-end testing

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - Implement `ModelMonitor` class in `scripts/ai_engine/`
   - Add performance instrumentation to all AI model API calls
   - Create metrics aggregation and storage system
   - Implement request/response logging with performance tracking

3. **Basic Alerting**
   - Set up threshold-based alerts for response time and error rates
   - Implement email/Slack notification system
   - Create alert escalation rules based on severity levels
   - Build alert suppression logic to prevent notification spam

### Phase 2: Advanced Monitoring (Sprint 3-4)
1. **Dashboard and Visualization**
   - Create Grafana dashboards for model performance metrics
   - Implement real-time service status overview
   - Build historical performance analysis views
   - Create cost tracking and budget monitoring visualizations

2. **Intelligent Alerting**
   - Implement anomaly detection for performance regression
   - Create predictive failure alerts based on trend analysis
   - Build context-aware alerting with business impact assessment
   - Implement smart alert correlation to reduce noise

3. **Automation and Recovery**
   - Develop automated failover mechanisms
   - Implement circuit breaker patterns for failing models
   - Create automated scaling triggers based on demand
   - Build self-healing capabilities for common failure scenarios

### Technical Dependencies
- **New Dependencies**: `prometheus-client`, `requests` for health checks, `schedule` for periodic tasks
- **Infrastructure**: Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization
- **External Services**: PagerDuty/Slack APIs for alerting, Hugging Face API status endpoints

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Health check endpoint functionality testing
- [ ] Metrics collection accuracy validation
- [ ] Alert threshold calculation testing

- [ ] Performance measurement accuracy verification

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end monitoring workflow testing
- [ ] External alerting system integration testing
- [ ] Dashboard data accuracy validation
- [ ] Failover scenario testing with actual AI models
- [ ] Load testing for monitoring system overhead

### User Acceptance Tests
- [ ] SysAdmin workflow testing for incident response
- [ ] Dashboard usability testing for operations team
- [ ] Alert effectiveness testing during simulated outages
- [ ] Performance impact testing on main AI Engine Service
- [ ] Recovery time validation during planned maintenance

### Test Data
- Create synthetic load patterns for testing monitoring accuracy
- Prepare failure scenarios for testing alerting and recovery
- Build historical data sets for trend analysis validation
- Create test environments with controlled AI model responses
